# Specification Quality Checklist: Agent-First CLI Contract Reset

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-03-11  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No internal implementation details (languages, frameworks, internal APIs); externally visible contract details such as CLI commands and payload shapes remain specified
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No internal implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This spec intentionally defines CLI command names and payload shapes because the external CLI contract is the product surface for agent callers.
- Conflicts with older CLI direction are handled by forward-only supersession rather than compatibility aliases.
